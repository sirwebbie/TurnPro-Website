We are    committed to producing the most dependable products possible using the finest    materials available. We will produce the most energy efficient and    environmentally friendly equipment possible in order to protect our fragile    earth.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>HISTORY:</strong> The Power House, Inc., formerly known as    Lipman Electric Company, was established by the late Sam Lipman in 1947.<br />
          <br />
          The company operated in Baltimore, Maryland as an electrical construction,    electric motor sales and repair facility. In 1968, the Blumenthal family    acquired Lipman Electric and renamed the company, The Power House, Inc.<br />
          <br />
          The Power House, Inc., through one of its employees, developed a unique    method of melting and preventing ice buildup around boats and piers.<strong> </strong></p></td>

        <td width="58%"><p align="center"><img src="images/fountain-page.jpg" width="700" height="345" /></p>
          <p align="left">In 1978, the United    States patent office awarded The Power House, Inc through its employee, a    patent for the Ice Eater. With the ability to direct water flow through its    venturi design, the Ice Eater began to change the landscape of the boating    industry. No longer did marina owners need to haul all their boats out of the    water during winter months. They finally had a viable option to the less than    reliable compressor systems.<br />
            <br />
            The first Ice Eaters were 1/3-hp units that drew 12.5 Amps. <br />
            <br />
            The original goal of The Power House, Inc. was to provide a dependable,    affordable and efficient &quot;insurance policy&quot; for marinas, waterfront    property and boat owners. <br />
            <br />
            Why risk losing an expensive dock to a hard winter freeze or seeing your    expensive boat damaged or destroyed by ice if someone offered a simple and    reliable solution? <br />
            <br />
            In June of 1986, a person complaining about fish kills on a tributary of the    Chesapeake Bay prompted The Power House into action. We designed a flotation    collar to go around the Ice Eater. The first day we began operating the Ice    Eater in her creek was the last day any fish died. By the end of the summer,    species of fish that hadn't been seen in a decade were returning. <br />
            <br />
            We sent a sample of our product to Auburn University to be independently    tested. Shortly after receiving impressive results, we began selling our    equipment as aerators to the fish farming industry. Our goal was to produce    the most effective aerator for generating the highest volume of oxygen    transfer at the least cost of purchase and operation as possible. <br />
            <br />
            Not wavering from our mission statement, The Power House, Inc. has developed    and built many new and more energy efficient units. Today we produce a 1-hp    unit that operates at 8.2 Amps at 115V, (4.1 Amps at 230V), and generates    more than 1150 gallons of water flow per minute. <br />
            <br />
            We were the first company to use environmentally friendly dielectric    lubricating fluid instead of hydrocarbon based oil in all our products. We    use only the finest materials available in the production of our MADE IN THE    USA equipment. We refuse to cut corners just to save a few dollars. <br />
            <br />
            Since the introduction of The Power House, Inc. aerators in 1986, we received    repeated requests to make our products into fountains. We have responded to    our customers&rsquo; requests and we are proud to introduce a variety of fountain    designs with optional lighting accents. <br />
            <br />
            We have manufactured tens of thousands of Ice Eaters, aerators and fountains.    Since we began production in 1978 we have had less than Â½ of 1% of our    products returned for warranty repair. <br />
          <strong>Affordable,    reliable, energy efficient, simple to install, easy to maintain - that is the    essence of every product manufactured by The Power House, Inc.</strong></p></td>
