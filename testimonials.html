    	  <p class="testimonial">John,
    	    
    	    Just a note to let you know that the pond is looking fantastic and I
    	    appreciate what you are doing to keep it that way.
    	    Thanks,</p>
    	  <p class="testimonial">Thanks so much for the great work you and the team do to keep my pond looking great. Mitch did a tremendous job after taking over my service. The fishing was awesome this year and my new catfish have already quadrupled in size! My boys are having a blast on the pond every day. Thanks again and we’ll see you in 2017! Thanks so much, Jason from Glenpool </p>
    	  <p class="testimonial">Thanks, John...we appreciate your looking out for us - there's no comparison in the quality of our lakes compared to the last few years.  With all this 100+ temperatures we would be walking knee deep in algae. Your a blessing...</p>


<p class="testimonial">Thanks, John...<br />

I'm wondering if you have a special connection with our God in heaven. We've been praying for rain, but it seems that within a day or two of you treating our lakes that we get rain.  I would suppose that you pray as you work - it poured here early this morning and though I haven't been down to the lakes, I'm sure they must be full again..just a thought.
Have a blessed day, we appreciate you and your attentiveness to our needs here at Savannah Lakes.</p>

<p class="testimonial">John,<br />
Thank you for all your services this spring and summer.  The pond has never
looked better. Everyone in the HOA is so very happy!!!</p>

        
        <p class="testimonial">Hello.<br />
I hope you have a good Christmas Holiday.<br />
I will continue to use the services you provide.<br />
It did miracles to our 2 ponds, I cannot be happier with the outcome and clarity they have.<br />
They went from pure GREEN to clear, it is amazing and I would be more than happy to give you references if you ever need them to further your business.<br />
I will fax the contract back over the next couple days.</p>
<p class="testimonial-sig">Thanks Again<br />
